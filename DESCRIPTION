Title: Significance of Boundaries
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Ruan de Wet and Dirk Snyman
Maintainer: Ruan de Wet <ruan.de.wet@c4es.co.za>
Description: Separates significant boundary constraints in a dataset from illusions. A modified permutation test is applied using the no-data zone areas above the top-left, top-right, bottom-right and bottom-left boundary lines as test statistics. The observed no-data zone areas are compared to the distribution of the random permutations to calculate a p-value for each boundary line. An article detailing the methodologies and rationale is currently in preparation.
